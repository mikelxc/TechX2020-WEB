# Color gradient

GOAL: create a website that generates a color gradient for its background.



## User Stories:

1. I have a div with the id ```container``` that is styled to show a background gradient with some default colors
2. I have two ```<input type='color' ...>``` elements to select starting and ending colors of my background gradient
3. I am able to obtain the colors of the inputs to set the background gradient dynamically, using JavaScript and DOM manipulation
4. I can reset the background gradient to its default colors with a ```<button>```, using JavaScript

### Optional Improvements:
1.  I have buttons to further customize my background, such as changing gradient direction, change background to a solid color, etc.
2.  I have a button to swap my background gradient
3.  I have a button to randomize my background colors

Or any other feature you would like to implement!

### Tips:
- Get a basic idea with snapshots in ```./result_snapshots```
- Access elements with id using ```document.getElementById(‘id’)```
